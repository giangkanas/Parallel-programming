In this project, we have to create a simple implementation of K-Means algorithm using C. 

At task_1 and task_2 we have to implement the basic functions that we maybe need.

At task_3, we use realistic values for the dimensions of the arrays.

At task_4 and task_5 we compile using -O2 and vector_processing (SIMD)
